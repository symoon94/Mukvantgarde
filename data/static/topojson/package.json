  "description": "**TopoJSON** is an extension of GeoJSON that encodes topology. Rather than representing geometries discretely, geometries in TopoJSON files are stitched together from shared line segments called *arcs*. This technique is similar to [Matt Blochâ€™s MapShaper](http://www.cartogis.org/docs/proceedings/2006/bloch_harrower.pdf) and the [Arc/Info Export format, .e00](https://web.archive.org/web/20140721114041/http://indiemaps.com:80/blog/2009/02/e00parser-an-actionscript-3-parser-for-the-arcinfo-export-topological-gis-format/).",
